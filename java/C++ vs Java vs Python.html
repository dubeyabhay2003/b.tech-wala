            <h2 class="int"><strong>C++, Java, and Python Comparison:</strong></h2>

            <p>These three programming languages stand out as the most popular choices among coders, particularly in the realms of competitive coding and general programming.</p>
            
            <p><strong>C++:</strong><br>
            C++ remains highly favored for its efficiency, speed, and memory management, making it a top choice among coders today.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Java:</strong><br>
            Java boasts platform independence, a key feature that contributes significantly to its enduring value in the realm of software development. It continues to be widely utilized and appreciated.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Python:</strong><br>
            Python, known for its readability and conciseness, requires less typing and offers a plethora of libraries. Its support for fast prototyping and incorporation of various new features contribute to its popularity among developers.</p>
            
            <p>In summary, each of these languages has its unique strengths, catering to different needs within the coding community.</p>
