    <h2 class="int">Intro of java</h2>
    <p>
        Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language designed to minimize implementation dependencies.
        The principle behind Java is "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that once Java code is compiled, it
        can run on any platform supporting Java without requiring recompilation. Introduced in 1995, Java quickly
        gained popularity for developing applications across desktop, web, and mobile devices. Its simplicity,
        robustness, and robust security features have made it a preferred choice for enterprise-level applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        James Gosling, initially developing Java in 1991 along with Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton
        (collectively known as the Green team) at Sun Microsystems Inc., later saw Java being acquired by Oracle
        Corporation. Java simplifies the tasks of writing, compiling, and debugging programs, emphasizing the
        creation of reusable and modular code. As a class-based, object-oriented language, Java minimizes
        implementation dependencies and ensures that compiled Java code, in the form of bytecode, can execute on
        any Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The syntax of Java closely resembles that of C/C++.
    </p>
    <p>
        Java's history unfolds with the initiation of the Java language by the Green team in 1991. The first public
        implementation, Java 1.0, was released by Sun Microsystems in 1996, offering no-cost run-times on various
        platforms. The Java 1.0 compiler underwent a significant transformation when Arthur Van Hoff rewrote it in
        Java, ensuring strict compliance with specifications. Subsequent versions, starting with Java 2, featured
        multiple configurations tailored for different platform types.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1997, Sun Microsystems engaged with the ISO standards body to formalize Java, but it later withdrew from
        the process. Despite its proprietary software status, Sun, at one point, provided many Java implementations
        without charge. Sun's revenue generation from Java involved selling licenses for specialized products, such
        as the Java Enterprise System. The open-sourcing of Java's virtual machine core code in 2006 marked a
        significant shift toward making Java more accessible. By 2007, Sun had completed this process, releasing
        all JVM core code under open-source distribution terms. Java has since continued to evolve and remains a
        fundamental technology in the world of software development.
    </p>
    <p>
        On November 13, 2006, Sun Microsystems released a substantial portion of its Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as
        free, open-source software. This process was completed on May 8, 2007, making the core code of JVM available
        under open-source distribution terms.
    </p>

    <p>
        The principles guiding the creation of Java encompassed simplicity, robustness, security, high-performance,
        portability, multi-threading, interpretation, dynamism, and more. In 1995, James Gosling, often referred to
        as the Father of Java, developed the language. Today, Java finds applications in mobile devices, internet
        programming, games, e-business, and various other domains.

    <h2 class="int">Java Application Program Development Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Creating the Program:</strong> Use a Text Editor (Notepad) or an IDE (NetBeans).</li>
        <pre><code>class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("My First Java Program.");
}
}</code></pre>
        <p>File -> Save -> <code>d:\Test.java</code></p>

        <li><strong>Compiling the Program:</strong> Run the Java compiler (javac) from the command prompt.</li>
        <pre><code>javac Test.java</code></pre>
        <p>If successful, the compiler creates a file named "Test.class" containing the program's bytecode.</p>

        <li><strong>Running the Program:</strong> Use the Java Interpreter to execute the program.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Before starting, ensure that the Java Development Kit (JDK) is properly installed on your system, and the
        path is set.
    </p>

    <h2 class="int">Why is it Named Java?</h2>
    <p>
        Originally named OAK, the team sought a new name reflecting the essence of technology. Suggested names like
        Silk, Jolt, revolutionary, DNA, and dynamic were considered. Java emerged as a top choice, preferred for its
        uniqueness. The name has no acronym and was inspired by the island in Indonesia where the first coffee
        (java coffee) was produced. James Gosling chose this name during a coffee break near his office.
    </p>

    <h2 class="int">Java Terminology</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Java Virtual Machine (JVM):</strong> Known as JVM, it undergoes three execution phases:
            writing, compiling, and running the program. Writing is done by Java programmers, compilation is
            performed by the JAVAC compiler, and running involves the execution of bytecode generated by the
            compiler. JVM ensures platform independence.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Bytecode in the Development Process:</strong> Javac compiler of JDK compiles Java source code
            into bytecode saved as .class files. Tools like javap can be used to view bytecode.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Java Development Kit (JDK):</strong> A comprehensive development kit including a compiler,
            Java Runtime Environment (JRE), debuggers, and documentation. JDK installation is necessary for
            creating, compiling, and running Java programs.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Java Runtime Environment (JRE):</strong> Included in JDK, JRE allows Java programs to run but
            lacks the ability to compile. It comprises a browser, JVM, applet support, and plugins.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Garbage Collector:</strong> In Java, the Garbage Collector recollects objects that are no
            longer referenced, simplifying memory management for programmers.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>ClassPath:</strong> The file path where Java runtime and compiler look for .class files. JDK
            provides default libraries, and additional libraries must be added to the classpath.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="int">Main Features of Java</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Platform Independent:</strong> Java's compiler converts source code to bytecode, allowing
            execution on different platforms. This architecture-neutral bytecode contributes to Java's
            platform-independent nature.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Object-Oriented Programming Language:</strong> Java organizes programs based on objects,
            incorporating concepts like abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Simple:</strong> Java eliminates complex features like pointers and explicit memory
            allocation, making it a straightforward language.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Robust:</strong> Java emphasizes error-checking, incorporating features like garbage
            collection, exception handling, and efficient memory allocation.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Secure:</strong> Absence of pointers in Java enhances security, preventing access to
            out-of-bound arrays and minimizing security flaws.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Distributed:</strong> Java facilitates the creation of distributed applications using
            technologies like Remote Method Invocation and Enterprise Java Beans.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Multithreading:</strong> Java supports concurrent execution of multiple program parts,
            maximizing CPU utilization.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Portable:</strong> Java code written on one machine can run on another due to its
            platform-independent bytecode.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>High Performance:</strong> Java architecture, including Just In Time (JIT) compilation,
            enhances performance by compiling methods on demand.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Dynamic Flexibility:</strong> Java's object-oriented nature provides flexibility to add
            classes, new methods, and create new classes through subclasses. Support for native methods in
            languages like C and C++ adds versatility.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Sandbox Execution:</strong> Java programs run in a separate space, ensuring execution without
            affecting the underlying system. The bytecode verifier enhances security by checking for access
            violations.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Write Once Run Anywhere:</strong> Java applications generate a ‘.class’ file with
            architecture-neutral bytecode, enabling execution on different platforms. This feature is pivotal for
            Java's extensive use in the IT industry.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Power of Compilation and Interpretation:</strong> Java integrates both compilation and
            interpretation. The Java compiler converts source code to bytecode, and JVM executes this bytecode to
            machine OS-dependent executable code.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="int">Java Class Terminology</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>class:</strong> Used to declare classes in Java.</li>
        <li><strong>public:</strong> An access specifier indicating visibility to all.</li>
        <li><strong>static:</strong> A keyword to make a function static. The main() method is called by JVM
            without creating an object for the class.</li>
        <li><strong>void:</strong> The return type, indicating the function will not return anything.</li>
        <li><strong>main:</strong> The most important method in a Java program, where all the logic must be
            inside. The absence of a main() method causes compilation errors.</li>
        <li><strong>String[] args:</strong> Signifies that users may enter parameters at the command line. Both
            forms, String[] args and String args[], are accepted by the Java compiler.</li>
        <li><strong>System.out.println:</strong> Used to print on the console, similar to “printf” in C
            language.</li>
    </ul>
