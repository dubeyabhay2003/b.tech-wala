    <h2 class="int">History of java:</h2><br>
    <p>Java, a popular programming language, was created by James Gosling and his team in the early 1990s. Originally, they aimed to develop a language for digital devices like set-top boxes. Initially considering C++, they shifted to creating a new platform called "Green" but later renamed it "OAK."</p>

    <p>The name "OAK" was inspired by an oak tree outside Gosling's office, symbolizing strength. However, due to trademark issues, they had to change it. After brainstorming, they chose "JAVA," a unique name from the Java coffee bean, decided during a coffee break.</p>
    
    <p>Java was built on principles like robustness, portability, platform independence, high performance, and multithreading. It gained recognition, named one of the Ten Best Products of 1995 by TIME MAGAZINE. Today, Java is widely used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, and e-business solutions.</p>
    
    <p>The language evolved over time, with changes and additions to the standard library. Java's success lies in its versatility, simplicity, and the extensive community support it has garnered since its inception.
